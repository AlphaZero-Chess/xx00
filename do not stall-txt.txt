Now I have a complete understanding of the codebase. Based on my analysis, here are the key issues and improvements needed to make this bot truly AlphaZero-like:

**Key Analysis:**
1. The current MCTS implementation is simplified - it doesn't do true tree search with proper backpropagation
2. The strategic planning is limited to heuristics, not deep simulation-based evaluation  
3. Long-term planning (50+ moves) is mentioned but not properly implemented
4. The "web-weaving" ability mentioned needs neural-network-style pattern recognition
5. Endgame play needs more sophisticated zugzwang/opposition detection
6. The current rollout system is basic, not AlphaZero's self-play style

Let me now implement the major improvements to create a true AlphaZero replica:
Action: Based on my analysis, the key improvements needed for true AlphaZero-like behavior:

1. TRUE MCTS with proper tree search, UCB1 selection, backpropagation
2. Deep strategic planning with 30+ move horizon evaluation 
3. Enhanced positional evaluation with "web-weaving" detection
4. Perfect endgame technique with opposition, triangulation, zugzwang
5. Long-term planning that rewards "delayed gratification" moves
6. Better threat/counterplay generation when behind
7. Zero blunder system with deeper tactical horizon

Let me create comprehensive improvements to these systems.
